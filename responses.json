                "The primary cause of lung cancer is cigarette smoking, which accounts for the majority of cases. Other risk factors include exposure to secondhand smoke, radon gas, asbestos, air pollution, certain chemicals (such as arsenic, uranium, and coal products), a family history of lung cancer, and previous radiation therapy to the chest."
            ],
            "complications": ["Lung cancer can lead to various complications, including metastasis (spreading) of cancer to other parts of the body, such as the liver, bones, brain, or other lung, leading to secondary tumors. It can also cause respiratory difficulties, pneumonia, pleural effusion (accumulation of fluid in the space around the lungs), and other respiratory infections."],
            "current research": ["Ongoing research in lung cancer focuses on several areas, including targeted therapies and immunotherapies. Targeted therapies aim to inhibit specific genetic mutations or proteins present in cancer cells, while immunotherapies harness the body's immune system to fight cancer cells. Additionally, researchers are exploring new screening methods, biomarkers for early detection, and advancements in surgical techniques."],
            "diagnosis": ["Diagnosing lung cancer involves various tests and procedures. These include imaging tests such as X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Biopsies, obtained through methods like bronchoscopy, needle biopsy, or surgery, are also conducted to analyze lung tissue and confirm the presence of cancer cells."],
            "epidemiology": ["Lung cancer has a significant global impact. It affects both men and women, with a higher incidence in males. The incidence and mortality rates vary across different regions due to variations in smoking prevalence and exposure to risk factors. However, it remains a major public health concern worldwide."],

            "prevention": ["Prevention of lung cancer primarily involves reducing exposure to risk factors. The most effective preventive measure is avoiding or quitting smoking. Additionally, minimizing exposure to secondhand smoke, radon gas, asbestos, and other known carcinogens can help reduce the risk. Occupational safety measures and air pollution reduction can also contribute to prevention."],
            "prognosis": ["The prognosis for lung cancer varies depending on the stage at diagnosis, overall health, and specific characteristics of the cancer. Early-stage lung cancers have a better prognosis, while advanced-stage cancers have a poorer prognosis. Treatment options and response to therapy also influence the prognosis."],
            "risk factors": ["Several risk factors increase the likelihood of developing lung cancer. The most significant risk factor is smoking, including both active smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke. Other risk factors include exposure to environmental toxins, genetic predisposition, family history of lung cancer, previous radiation therapy, and certain occupational exposures."],
            "symptoms": [
                "Common symptoms of lung cancer include a persistent cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, hoarseness, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, recurrent respiratory infections, coughing up blood, and wheezing. However, it's important to note that some individuals may be asymptomatic in the early stages of the disease."

                "Treatment options for lung cancer depend on the type and stage of cancer, as well as the overall health of the individual. They may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or a combination of these approaches. Treatment aims to remove or destroy cancerous cells, control the disease, alleviate symptoms, and improve quality of life."
